        <h2 class="name">1. Rick Astley</h2>
        <h5 class="description">Born in 1966, Rick Astley has become one of the greatest and most iconic Ricks of all time. Chances are, you've seen him at
            least once in your life, whether accidentally or intentionally. The effects of his hit song "Never Gonna Give You Up" are far-reaching and yet still ongoing due to its massive presence in online spaces.</h5>

    <div class="number-2">
        <h2 class="name">2. Rick Sanchez</h2>
        <h5 class="description">To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is
            extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical
            viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his
            personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this
            stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that
            they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty
            truly ARE uncultured- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential
            catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers
            and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in
            confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity
            them. ðŸ˜‚</h5>
